//! Assignment 2: Mastering common programming concepts (1/2).
//!
//! The primary goal of this assignment is to re-learn the common programming concepts in Rust, especially those in the Rust Book chapters 3 and 5.
//! Please make sure you're comfortable with the concepts to proceed on to the next assignments.
//!
//! You should fill out the `todo!()` placeholders in such a way that `/scripts/grade-02.sh` works fine.
//! See `*_grade.rs` and `/scripts/grade-02.sh` for the test script.
