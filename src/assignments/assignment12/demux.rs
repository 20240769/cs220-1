//! Demultiplexing sender
//!
//! Implement demultiplexing sender
//! Demultiplexer, `Demux` in short, is a device that has one input and many outputs.
//! It distributes the input to the outputs according to the control signal.
//! It is used when a circuit wishes to send a signal to one of many devices.
//! For more information, refer <https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/combination/comb_3.html>
//!
//! In this assignment, closure `f` will be given as an argument to `demux` function.
//! This closure will be used to determine which destination to send the input data.
//!
//! Refer `demux_grade.rs` for test cases
